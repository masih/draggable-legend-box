# Highcharts Draggable Legend Box
Makes the [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) legend box draggable.

This a fork of [draggable-legend](https://github.com/highslide-software/draggable-legend).
In the original version the legend is dragged by its title; a legend without a title cannot be made draggable.
This version makes the legend box draggable regardless of the existence of a legend title.

The contents of the plugin is located in the javascript file [`draggable-legend-box.js`](https://github.com/masih/draggable-legend-box/blob/master/draggable-legend-box.js).
